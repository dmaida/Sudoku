### Description:

The purpose of this project is to create a Sudoku Puzzle Solving Agent. 
Two distinct solution strategies will be implemented and evaluated.
In this paper we will be exploring a constraint satisfaction algorithm called
Backtracking to solve a Sudoku puzzle. In addition to Backtracking, we will be
exploring a less traditional algorithm, Stochastic Hill Climbing, for a constraint 
satisfaction problem such as Sudoku. 

We implemented three distint methods for extra credit. 

### Run/Compile:

In a Unix Enviroment such as Linux or Mac OS X.

$python3 main.y <method> <puzzle>

method options:
	backtracking
	backtracking_prime 
	hillclimbing
